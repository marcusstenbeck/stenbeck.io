		<h3>Work Experience</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Intuitive Aerial</h4>
				<p>Linköping, Sweden</p>
				<p>November 2014 — February 2014 (currently active)</p>
				<p>Branding &amp; Marketing Manager and Content Producer</p>
				<p>A contract position where I am helping define core brand values, translating those brand values into marketing strategy, and producing marketing content. This includes modern Wordpress development with Roots + Bedrock.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Goo Technologies</h4>
				<p>Stockholm, Sweden</p>
				<p>January 2013 – May 2014 (1 year, 4 months)</p>
				<p>Developer — Community Manager — Interface Designer</p>
				<p>I took a break from my studies to join the WebGL-based startup Goo Technologies. For the first six months I contributed to the development of their WebGL-based game engine, and to the development of their online games authoring too, Goo Create. The coming six months after I assisted the development team with product design while also taking on the role as community manager. During this time we launched Goo Create, at which time I transitioned to working on interface design, application metrics, and to a minor extend data mining.</p>

				<p>During my time at Goo Technologies I was a driving force in implementing constant work culture improvements, introducing team collaboration tools and process. I was also involved in recruiting two developers, one community manager, and support staff.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Mindfly Studio</h4>
				<p>Bellingham, WA</p>
				<p>March 2007 – December 2007 (8 months)</p>
				<p>Web Designer</p>
				<p>Although starting as a part-time employee, my eagerness to learn and understand how to quickly deliver standards compliant web sites quickly earned me a full-time position. I grew an interest for designing and implementing accessible web sites, and I left the company only because I wanted to pursue a university degree. This was my first professional endeavor in professional web development.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Macatak Media</h4>
				<p>Sweden</p>
				<p>2009 – Present (5 years)</p>
				<p>Videographer — Animator — Web Development</p>
				<p>At the side of school I have taken on a number of video projects for clients, taking them from idea to finished video. In the process I’ve done some animation and motion graphics. Occasionally I’ve taken on small client web projects, usually in the form of Wordpress development.</p>

		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>Linköping University</p>
		<p>MSc. Engineering and Media Technology</p>
		<p>August 2008 – December 2012, May 2014 – November 2014</p>
		<p>The Masters of Science and Engineering in Media Technology combines classical engineering disciplines—like physics, advanced mathematics, and automatic control systems—computer science subjects—such as algorithms and design patterns—and human-computer interaction and visualization courses. My personal preference of studies within the program leaned towards programming, computer graphics, and agile software development as these topics complemented my natural interest for web development and user experience design.</p>
