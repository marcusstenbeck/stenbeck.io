If you search Twitter for #1GAM you'll find tons of people who are committed to making one game per month, often with the goals of having 12 games finished in the span of 12 months. The reason is to gain experience making games. I love the idea, and I don't think it should be limited to game devs.

In 2014, Pieter Levels ([levels.io](http://levels.io)) accepted the same kind of challenge, but instead of targeting games he chose to create one online product per month (or as he likes to call it "[12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/)"). He's in month 10 now, and the experience has made a ton of difference for him.

Granted, he *did* kind of hit gold, and it has influenced the theme of a few projects he's continued with. His most popular project [nomadlist.io](http://nomadlist.io) has received an incredible amount of attention from press, and from users who love it. But he's still releasing new projects and challenging himself. And that's what I believe is the most important thing. Furthermore, he wouldn't have arrived at his breakout success if he didn't stick with it through the earlier, less successful projects.

I believe that becoming better at programming has a lot to do with how much you program. If you're constantly challenging yourself with projects and making sure your brain is regularly churning on some problem then you'll undoubtedly improve with time. I think this is true for quite a while, but it's likely that there is a point in time where the complexity of the projects start to make a difference becoming better.

I'm not at that point. So I <s>need</s> want to program as much as possible.

So, 2015, *what's goin' on?*

I'm gonna make 12 creative coding project babies with you. Hope you're ready. **#1PAM**
