My name is Marcus Stenbeck. I'm a minimalist and I enjoy creative coding, interactive development, or any other terms you have for it. I'm on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/marcusstenbeck/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcusstenbeck), and [Github](https://github.com/marcusstenbeck).

If you're interested I also have profiles on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mstenbeck), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/marcusstenbeck), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/marcusstenbeck).

Oh, and [e-mail](mailto:{{ site.email }}) too.

That's it.
